Bassoon - Cross Platform .NET (Core) Audio Playback
###################################################

A simple C#/.NET API to load & play audio files.  Currently supports WAV, AIFF, OGG, Vorbis, FLAC,
and more (see ``libsndfile``'s official documentation), on Windows, OS X, and Linux.

This project now includes all the native nuget libraries! Yes, all of them! No more hassles of having
to set up the dev environment manually anymore, that's all in the past now :)

Also note that this is an improved fork of the original repo, found here:
[Bassoon]: https://gitlab.com/define-private-public/Bassoon/-/tree/develop/src/Bassoon/Bassoon/

This project has some slight changes over the original, mainly with the directory structures.

Hopefully I will improve this project even more in the future.

If you'd like to help contribute to the project, by all means, the entire repo is here:
